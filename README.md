# onepiece-place
OnePiece /r/place repo to store the template and script for outlining the place to put titles 

This script & repo are cloned from [Anticept/httyd-place](https://github.com/anticept/httyd-place) to allow multiple people to be able to update a template image.

## HOW TO USE THE TEMPLATE AND SCRIPT ON /r/place
Our friends at r/osuplace have made an overlay script! Use this to make sure you're placing pixels in the right spot.

## Coordination Efforts

We're coordinating at [discord.gg/QpgpC53aSr] and on [reddit.com/r/onepiece]

## To edit the template:

Edit the [onepiece_full.png](onepiece_full.png) file without changing the pixel dimensions. Then run the [dithering.py](dithering.py) script on the image. PR:

* YOUR EDITED onepiece_full.png
* the output onepiece_template.png

Merge it!
